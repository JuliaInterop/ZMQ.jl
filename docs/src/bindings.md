# Bindings

This page documents the low-level bindings to libzmq that were automatically
generated. Where possible, the docstrings link to the [upstream
documentation](https://libzmq.readthedocs.io). Bindings have not been generated
for deprecated functions.

!!! danger
    These bindings are unsafe, do not use them unless you know what you're doing.
